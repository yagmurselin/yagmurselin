### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**yagmurselin/yagmurselin** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

Hi, I'm Selin and I'm a fresh graduate computer engineer. I've been working on React for a while then I decided to put my works in Github(better late than ever). 

Until two years ago I was just a student who tries to get better grades without any practise on-hand coding. Then I started my first internship program as a React-Native intern.
That was the first interaction between me and Javascript and I've found it very interesting and entertaining.
Well, it's still interesting but I don't find it as entertaining as before because as you learn you see that it's deeper than you could imagine and makes you feel like you know nothing.
And with this 'I know nothing' thought I focus on it better now.

At this internship program I've created a tourism app [a link] (https://www.reactnative-themes.com/tourzio)
